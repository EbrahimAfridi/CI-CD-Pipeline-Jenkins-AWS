# Stages in this pipeline
## There are a total of 5 Stages in this pipeline.
## Build
It's nothing like building going on here, It's just showing some outputs.
## Lint HTML
This stage Checks for the Errors in The Static HTML file, If there are any errors, It outputs Exit Code 1 and pipeline Stops. Else The pipeline continues.
## Security Scan
This stage Scans the Docker Image file for vulnerebilities and outputs it on the console.
* There's one functionality of this Stage which I commented because I could not find or build a proper Image file. It stops the pipeline if the Security Risks in the image file is of HIGH or CRITICAL.
## Upload to AWS
This Stage consists of uploading the Static HTML file which were Earlier checked for errors in the 2nd Stage. This STep uses a Plugin "Pipeline: AWS Steps" to do the task.
The region and credentials for Authorisation are provided.
* Here I have specified 'jenkins' in Credentials and I know you are wondering what 'jenkins' is. So actually I have Saved The AWS Credentials 'Access key ID' and 'Secret access Key' as global credentials with ID 'jenkins'.
## Deploy Website to Nginx Container
A lot of things are going on in this Step.
* The previous Docker Nginx Container is Stopped and Deleted
* The Static Files are copied from S3
* A new Docker container is spinned up listining to port 80
* The Static files are now copied to html folder in the container.
